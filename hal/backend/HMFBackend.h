 *
 * This file provides the description (or includes other files) of the low level
 * HAL interface for the HICANN chip, DNC and FPGA functionality.
 *
 * Design Principle:
 * =================
 * - Each function itself is stateless - no statics, no globals!
 * - We use "handles" to represent the communication stream.
 * - The communication stream is encapsulated, access to shared data via atomic
 *   operations.
 * - Data needs to be stored and managed on a higher level in the hierarchy
 *   (i.e. some stateful HAL => StHAL).
 *
 * The Coordinate System
 * =====================
 *
 * Representing the overall possible connectivity across borders of individual
 * chip would require huge connectivity matrices which is neither practicable
 * nor modular. Therefore, implicit knowledge about connection possibilities is
 * still required. Since routing is a global operation and the most complex task
 * the major goal was to ease coding by making the L1 topology addressing
 * consistent with regards to a Cartesian coordinate system. Furthermore,
 * addressing all directly connected components by their corresponding L1
 * address.
 *
 * Special Coordinates:
 * -------------------
 * * HWire                : horizontal bus wires addresses:
 *    * range from 0 (left) to 223 (right) for synapsedriver switch rows
 *    * range from 0 (left) to 63 (right)  for crossbar switch rows
 * * Side(SideHorizontal) : either LEFT or RIGHT
 * * SideVertical         : either TOP or BOTTOM
